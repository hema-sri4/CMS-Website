## Content Management System Website
This Content Management System is in PHP and CSS. Talking about the features of the system, 
it contains the Admin and user section. From here, the admin can view and edit the posts and users according to their levels. 
The design of this project is pretty simple so that the user wonâ€™t 
find any difficulties while working on it. This System in PHP helps in easy 
management of various posts and the editors for content editing.
